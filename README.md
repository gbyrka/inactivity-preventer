# inactivity-preventer

## About

A script to prevent screensaver and power saver mode activation.

This script ensures that your computer does not go to sleep at an inappropriate time. 
It is worth using it when giving presentations, downloading large files from the Internet, or when some background process should not be interrupted, but it cannot take care of it itself.


## Usage

### Windows 10 and 11

Simply go to the script directory and type in:

`.\move.ps1`

To deactivate, simply press 

`Ctrl + c`

And if you want this script to work in the background, run it like this:

`./move.sh & exit`

### LINUX

Simply go to the script directory and type in:

`./move.sh`

To deactivate, simply press 

`Ctrl + c`

And if you want this script to work in the background, run it like this:

`./move.sh & exit`
